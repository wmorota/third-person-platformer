# third-person-platformer
A 3D third person platform game made in Unity and written in C#

In this game, the player controls Unity-chan as they try to complete several levels making sure they don't fall off the moving platforms while collecting as much gems as they can for points and to reach the finish line before the timer finishes.

As a player completes a level or uses up all their lives, their score is calculated based on how many gems they were able to collect and with how fast they were able
to finish a level.

Try to aim for the highest score! Enjoy! ヾ(＾∇＾)
